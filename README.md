## Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test driven development is a software development process where you write tests before writing the software code.

Once the tests have been written, you then write the code to ensure the tests pass

1. Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature
2. Write software code that will run tests successfully when re-exceuted
3. Refactore the code for optimization while ensuring the tests continue to pass

Also called red-green testing as all tests go from a red failed state to green passed state.

## Filename Conventions

- `.test.js` or `.test.jsx` suffix
